## the features and technologies that you used in your creation
When I was young, I had a hard time because I was not good at understanding how I felt and expressing how I felt to others. I felt that other people don't understand me because the way other people generally express their feelings is different. For example, I felt excited while making a snowman and playing today because it snowed. I had difficulty expressing "exciting" emotions verbally, and I had tried to express them in other ways. I have communicated with my parents by drawing pictures and expressing them in colors. Through this, I was able to solve the difficulty of expressing emotions verbally, and rather, I was able to express emotions more deeply and specifically than expressing them in words, so I could express them better.

'My Mood Weather' is an iPadOS application designed to help children understand and express their emotions. It uses weather to express emotions, which helps children understand their emotions visually and audibly. By doing so, children are encouraged to express their emotions actively and accept them naturally. The activities in the 'My Mood Weather' enable children to choose background colors that match their mood, which enhances their sense of autonomy and self-efficacy.

According to research studies, children aged 5-7 typically have difficulty expressing their emotions in a concrete way, often resorting to non-verbal methods such as actions or gestures, as reported in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology and the Journal of Child Language. They often use non-verbal methods such as actions or gestures rather than expressing themselves in words. Therefore, this app aims to help children overcome this challenge by providing an interactive platform for them to learn how to understand and express their emotions. The app's use of colors, weather, and sounds to express emotions can also help facilitate communication and relationship-building between parents and children, thereby promoting healthy emotional development.
