## What is "My Mood Weather"?
Children aged 5-7 often have difficulty expressing their emotions in concrete terms. Rather than verbally expressing their feelings, young children tend to express themselves through nonverbal means such as actions or gestures. They may struggle to identify their emotions as they may not fully understand them. Additionally, their language abilities may be limited, making it challenging for them to express their feelings appropriately. "My Mood Weather" uses weather to represent emotions, helping children to understand their emotions visually, and encouraging them to express their emotions actively and to accept them naturally.

## About ‚ÄúMy Mood Weather‚Äù
My Mood Weather is an app designed to help young children actively understand and express their emotions. Children aged 5-7 commonly express their feelings through nonverbal behaviors such as actions or gestures rather than verbal communication. For example, when feeling angry, they may stomp their feet or swing their arms, and when feeling sad, they may cry.

Due to their limited language ability and emotional recognition skills, children may have difficulty expressing their emotions in words. My Mood Weather encourages children to understand their mood by associating it with weather, and helps them actively recognize and express their emotions. This activity can help children express their emotions proactively even in situations where it may be uncomfortable, and help them naturally accept their emotions.

The activity of allowing children to choose the background color of the picture according to their mood also respects their autonomy and helps improve their self-efficacy.
